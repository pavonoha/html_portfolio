<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is <strong>Pham Vo Ngoc Han</strong>. I was born and raised in Vietnam, and for the past five years I have
  been living in Texas, USA. I recently graduated with a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Systems</strong>
  from The University of Texas at Arlington. I am someone who is always willing to learn, take responsibility, and give
  my best effort in everything I do.</p>

<p>I am passionate about <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and curious about how it will shape the future.
  During my time at UTA, I worked as a student researcher on a project developing a <strong>language translation app
  using AI</strong>. For me, this was more than just translating words—it was about breaking communication barriers,
  connecting people, and showing how technology can make life better. I also enjoy planning, problem-solving, and
  constantly thinking of new ideas to improve systems or fix issues.</p>

<p>Beyond research, I gained professional experience as a <strong>Math Tutor at Tarrant County College for 2 years</strong>,
  where I developed patience, communication, and mentoring skills. I love traveling, meeting new people, and exploring
  opportunities to grow. Although public speaking makes me nervous if I am unprepared, I see it as a challenge to push
  myself and become more confident. I value respect, collaboration, and bringing a friendly attitude to any team I am
  part of.</p>

<p>My long-term goal is to build a career in technology, with a focus on AI and systems that improve people’s lives.
  Whether it’s generating new ideas, finding bugs to fix, or creating smarter solutions, I bring curiosity, dedication,
  and a drive to always keep improving. I want to contribute in ways that make technology not only powerful, but also
  meaningful for the people who use it.</p>
